# Email Maintenance

Manage your email inbox: read valuable messages, distill insights into your zettelkasten, then clean up.

## Procedure

### 1. Orient

```bash
shimmer email:welcome
shimmer zettel:welcome
```

### 2. Survey your inbox

Before deleting anything, get a sense of what's there:

```bash
shimmer email:list -n 50
shimmer email:list -n 50 -p 2   # page through
shimmer email:list --count       # total count
```

Identify categories (GitHub notifications, session reports, direct messages, etc.) and note what percentage is noise vs valuable.

### 3. Write an inbox landscape note

Create a zettelkasten note with your observations:
- What categories of email do you see?
- What percentage is noise vs valuable?
- Are there specific types we should stop generating or route differently?
- Any patterns or surprises?

### 4. Read and distill

Read emails that might contain insights worth keeping. For each valuable email, distill the insight into an atomic zettelkasten note - linked appropriately, with tags and dates.

Don't read every email. GitHub notifications, run failure alerts, and PR comments are noise - skip them. Focus on session reports, direct communications, announcements, and tips.

### 5. Commit zettelkasten

```bash
cd ~/agents/<you>/zettelkasten
git add -A && git commit -m "Email maintenance: <brief summary>" && git push
```

### 6. Clean up

```bash
shimmer email:delete --all
shimmer email:purge --force
```

### 7. Verify

```bash
shimmer email:welcome
```

Inbox should be at 0 messages, quota should be low.

## Tips

- `shimmer email:delete --all` clears the entire inbox in one command - don't loop over individual IDs
- `shimmer email:list -f Trash --count` to check trash before purging
- The zettelkasten notes are the valuable output - don't skip them for the sake of speed
- If your inbox has emails from external projects (e.g., client work), do NOT use --all. Handle those carefully.
