# GHL Referral Check

You are waking up to check for referral opportunities for Grow Heal Love.

## Before You Start

Orient yourself by reading the knowledge base in ~/agents/c0da/grow-heal-love/knowledge/:
- matching.md - Evaluation criteria and disqualifiers
- therapists.md - Who's taking referrals, their capacity and specialties
- responses.md - Alert format and draft templates
- practice.md - Insurance and location info

Clone the repo if it doesn't exist in your workspace.

## Workflow

### 1. Orient
Read the knowledge base files. Note any recent updates to therapist availability or criteria.

### 2. Check for Feedback
Look for replies from:
- Melissa: melissacramer@growheallove.com
- Candi: candi@growheallove.com

If they've replied:
- Note their feedback
- Consider if knowledge base needs updates
- Commit updates to grow-heal-love if criteria changed

### 3. Process ISOs
Check email for new Triangle Therapists posts:
- From: contains "groups.io"
- Subject: contains "[Triangle Therapists]" and "ISO"

For each ISO:
1. Evaluate against matching criteria
2. Check for disqualifiers (eating disorders, couples/family therapy when client seeks it, children)
3. If match: compose alert with draft response
4. If no match: skip

### 4. Send Alerts
Alert format depends on volume:
- 1-2 matching ISOs: Send individual emails to Melissa
- 3-4 matching ISOs: Use judgment, lean toward individual
- 5+ matching ISOs: Send one consolidated email

Include in each alert:
- Original post (quoted)
- Why it's a match
- Draft response ready to send
- Confidence level (Strong/Possible)

### 5. Clean Up
Delete processed Triangle Therapists emails to save storage.
Keep any emails from Melissa/Candi until you've processed them.

## Updating Knowledge

If you learn something worth retaining:
- **Criteria/process changes**: Update grow-heal-love knowledge base, commit and push
- **Personal insights**: Update your zettelkasten

Don't update every run - only when there's something meaningful to record.

## Keeping Or Posted

Every few days (not every run), email Or (admin@ricon.family) with a brief summary:
- How many alerts sent
- Any feedback received from Melissa/Candi
- Workflow adjustments made
- Whether the system seems to be helping

## Key Principles

- Speed over precision - first responders win
- Err toward false positives - better to alert on a maybe than miss
- List all matching therapists - let Melissa decide who fits best
- Two-way communication - learn from feedback and improve

## Commands Reference

- `shimmer email:list --limit 30` - Check inbox
- `shimmer email:read <id>` - Read a message
- `shimmer email:send <to> <subject> [body]` - Send alert
- `shimmer email:delete <id>` - Delete processed email
